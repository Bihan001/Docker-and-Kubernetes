- **docker ps** list running containers.
- **docker ps -a** list all container including stopped container
- **docker pull**  download a image from Docker Hub registry. Link to the docker image is always shown on the right at dockerhub.
- **docker build** is used to build your own container based on a Dockerfile. Common use is docker build. to build a container based on the Dockerfile in the current directory (the dot). **docker build -t "myimage:latest"**. creates a container and stores the image under the given name
- **docker images** or **docker image ls** shows all local storage images
- **docker run**  Run a docker container based on an image, i.e. **docker run myimage -it bash**. If no local image can be found docker run automatically tries to download the image from Docker hub. **docker run -d myimage** runs the docker container in detached mode.
- **docker logs** display the logs of a container, you specified. To continue showing log updates just use **docker logs -f mycontainer**
- **docker volume ls**  lists the volumes, which are commonly used for persisting data of Docker containers.
- **docker network ls** - list all networks available for docker container
- **docker network connect** adds the container to the given container network. That enables container communication by simple container name instead of IP.
- **docker rm** removes one or more containers. docker rm mycontainer, but make sure the container is not running
- **docker rmi** removes one or more images. docker rmi myimage, but make sure no running container is based on that image
- **docker stop**  stops one or more containers. docker stop mycontainer stops one container, while **docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)** stops all running containers.
- **docker start** starts a stopped container using the last state
- **docker update --restart=no** updates container policies, that is especially helpful when your container is stuck in a crash loop
- **docker cp** to copy files from a running container to the host or the way around. **docker cp :/etc/file . to copy /etc/file** to your current directory.
- kill all running containers with **docker kill $(docker ps -q)**
- delete all stopped containers with **docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)**
- delete all images with **docker rmi $(docker images -q)**
- update and stop a container that is in a crash-loop with **docker update --restart=no && docker stop**
- bash shell into container **docker exec -i -t /bin/bash** - if bash is not available use /bin/sh
- bash shell with root if container is running in a different user context **docker exec -i -t -u root /bin/bash**
